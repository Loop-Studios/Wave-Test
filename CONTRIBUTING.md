# How to Contribute to Wave

Wave is an open-source project. Anyone can contribute to the project.
However, if you want to contribute, there are a few things to keep in mind.

## Programming Languages

We use Rust as our main programming language.
However, once Wave is developed to a level where bootstrapping is possible, we plan to change the main programming language to Wave.

### Usable Programming Languages

* **[Wave](https://www.wave-lang.dev/)**
* **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**
* C/C++
* Go
* Kotlin
* Carbon
* Haskell
* Lisp
* Dart
* ML
* Nim
* Python
* Mojo
* Zig

## Code Conventions

We are setting guidelines for code writing.

### K&R

If you use a coding style other than K&R (such as BSD, GNU, etc.), your pull request may be rejected.
Even if it passes, we may have to change it back to K&R, so please be aware.

#### Examples

* Correct example
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

* Incorrect examples
```rust
fn main() 
{
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

```rust
fn main() 
    {
        println!("Hello World!");
    }
```
