## Wave

This is the main source code repository for the formula [Wave].

It contains the compiler.

### Project Overview

**Wave** is a new concept of a programming language, aiming to develop operating systems, system software, and applications using only the pure **Wave** language.
To achieve this, we plan to develop a **Wave** compiler with full hardware access through a gradual process.

### Project Necessity

Existing system programming has a high entry barrier, requiring the use of low-level languages such as **C** and **Assembly**.
Through **Wave**, we can lower this barrier and provide a more productive and secure system development environment.
This will lead to innovative technological advancements and the democratization of technology.

## CONTRIBUTING
