# Introduction

# Wave's Philosophy and Goals
Wave aims to fully replace low-level languages (such as the C language family, assembly language, etc.)
and establish an integrated ecosystem where everything can be developed with a single language.
This language encompasses all fields-web development, software programming, operating systems, 
artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networking, encryption, and more-offering 
high-level abstraction through a powerful standard library.

In particular, Wave's hardware library is designed to be accessible, allowing even those with 
limited hardware knowledge to work with hardware easily. Additionally, it provides the flexibility 
to directly control hardware in fine detail, bypassing the library when necessary.
This allows developers to use a range of hardware features intuitively while maximizing performance.

Through its unified language environment, Wave seeks to eliminate boundaries between languages during development, 
delivering a more intuitive and cohesive development experience.
