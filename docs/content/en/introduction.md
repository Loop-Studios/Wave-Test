# Introduction

## Wave's Philosophy and Goals
Wave completely replaces low-level languages (such as the C language family, assembly, etc.) and aims for an integrated ecosystem that can develop everything in a single language.
The language covers everything from web development, program writing, operating systems, artificial intelligence, blockchain, hardware, compilers, networks, encryption, etc,
It provides a high level of abstraction through a strong standard library.

In particular, Wave's hardware library is designed to be easy to handle without deep hardware knowledge.
It also gives you the flexibility to control your hardware directly without the need for this library.
This allows developers to intuitively use a variety of hardware features, while simultaneously maximizing performance.

Wave eliminates the boundaries between languages in the development process through an integrated language environment,
We want to provide a more intuitive and integrated development experience.
